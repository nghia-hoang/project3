Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.
1. IAM Role (InstanceRole) has full access to any s3 bucket instance. violate the principle of least privilege. a role must be specific to the list of resources and the actions performed on them
2. The WebAppSG security group Inbound rules All traffic from the internet to multiple ports exposing the server to attacks.
