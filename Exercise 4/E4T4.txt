# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
move webservices instance to private subnet and create a rule that any ssh to instances should be done through AWS Systems Manager, which removes all external access to the instances.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
using a private VPC endpoint does not prevent unauthorized access to the S3 secrets bucket

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
no old data will not be encrypted only new data will be encrypted

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
All configuration done directly through the AWS management console for the original cloud configuration will be reset.
