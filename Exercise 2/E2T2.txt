Provide recommendations
1. Server-side encryption and logging not enabled for S3 . buckets
2.UDP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet
3.Loadbalancer without HTTP->HTTPS redirect
4. The use of a non-root account is not enforced and Ensure hardware MFA is enabled for the root user

remediate the vulnerabilities
1.Enable S3 server-side encryption and logging
2.Disable all other non-necessary ports on the EC2 instance
3.Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
4.create a user with admin rights and enabled MFA for root user
